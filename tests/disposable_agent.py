"""A disposable agent: install skills into it, send it a message, throw it away.

`DisposableAgent` is a real agent you can talk to, built from scratch and owned by
the caller. Underneath it is a pinned opencode inside a redirected HOME, but a
test never needs to know that — it installs skills, calls `run()`, and reads the
transcript that comes back.

Nothing here touches the developer's real machine: HOME and all XDG_* point into
the given root directory, and the whole thing is deleted with it.

It knows nothing about which skills it installs. `install_skills` takes a
directory and copies whatever skill directories it finds, which is what let it
outlive the skills it was originally written for.

Shared by the pytest fixtures (tests/conftest.py) and the convenience script
(.scripts/disposable-agent.py) so there is exactly one definition of how one is
built.
